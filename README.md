### Hey, Iâ€™m Shirin ðŸ‘‹
I learned to love learning. ðŸ“š

ðŸ¤– These days, Iâ€™m diving into deep learning. 

ðŸŽ“ During my PhD, I explored how the brain learns and adapts movements through the experience of errors. A lot of that involved designing psychophysical experiments, building pipelines for behavioral and neuroimaging data analysis, computational modeling, and â€” essentially â€” writing code that worked (eventually)!

This space is where Iâ€™m collecting some of those projects, along with newer things Iâ€™m working on. Not everything is polished, but everything here taught me something. âœ¨
